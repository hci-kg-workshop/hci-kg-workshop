                <p>Knowledge Graphs are gaining in popularity; their ability to merge and connect information from different domains has many applications. 
                However, although the technology has been around for a while, it still does not present interfaces that are easy to use and understand.
                This workshop aims at bringing HCI and KG communities together to discuss how HCI methods could help identify and 
                overcome the issues that keep Knowledge Graphs from better user interfaces.</p>

                <h2>Organizers</h2>
                <p><h3>Marie Destandau</h3> is a PhD student in Human–computer interaction at INRIA, the French national research institute 
                    for digital sciences. Her PhD topic, Interactive Representation Techniques for the Web of Data, is about finding semi-automatic visualizations, 
                    optimised for human understanding, to present Linked Data. Her motivation is to address problems users have to access complex information, 
                    such as Knowledge Graphs, make sense of it and interact with it. She is a member of the organizing committee of Paris-Saclay University and Femmes & Sciences association's 
                    joint mentoring program. She served as a publicity chair for EICS 2018, as a PC member for SemWebPro (2017--2020) and the Music Encoding Conference 2021, and she regularly co-organizes local workshops and meetups. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lri.fr/~mdestandau/">lri.fr/~mdestandau</a></p>
                <p><h3>Ilaria Liccardi</h3> is a research scientist with the Internet Policy Research Initiative at MIT CSAIL. Previously she was a Marie Curie Fellow with the Decentralized Information Group at CSAIL (MIT) and with the Oxford e-Research Center (University of Oxford).
                    Her research aims to understand why people willingly to share their personal information either directly (consciously posting information online) or indirectly (granting access to services, apps etc.), especially the reasons for their lack of concern about possible harms and risks resulting from their sharing behavior.

                <p><h3>Ruben Verborgh</h3> is a professor of Decentralized Web technology
                    at IDLab, Ghent University – imec,
                    and a research affiliate
                    at the Decentralized Information Group of CSAIL at MIT.
                    Additionally, he acts as a technology advocate for Inrupt
                    and the Solid ecosystem
                    wherein people and organizations control their own data.
                    He aims to build a more intelligent generation
                    of clients for a decentralized Web
                    at the intersection of Linked Data and hypermedia-driven Web APIs.
                    He has co-authored two books on Linked Data,
                    and contributed to more than 250 publications
                    for international conferences and journals on Web-related topics.
                    In addition to serving on the editorial board of the Semantic Web Journal
                    and as a~senior PC member of multiple conferences,
                    has co-organized more than 20 workshops
                    and several large-scale international conferences,
                    including ISWC, ESWC, and SEMANTiCS. <a target="_blank" href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/">ruben.verborgh.org</a></p>
                <p><h3>Marco Winckler</h3> is Full Professor in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Université Côte d’Azur, Polytech Nice, Sophia Antipolis, France. He is member of the SPARKS/WIMMICS team which is a joint research team of the CNRS lab I3S and the INRIA Sophia Antipolis. His research combines topics of Engineering Interactive Systems (such as models for specifying the behaviour of interactive systems, tools and techniques for supporting user-cantered design) and Information Visualization (such as chained visualizations and visualization of linked data/semantic Web). Along his career, Marco Winckler has been involved in the organization of more than 30 conferences and workshops, the most recent ones include ACM AVI 2020 (Technical Program co-chair), ACM Symposium EICS 2020 (General chair),  INTERACT 2019 (Technical Program co-chair). He also has served as Workshop chair for EICS 2019 and EICS 2013.
