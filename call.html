          Knowledge Graphs are gaining in popularity; their ability to merge and
          connect information from different domains has many applications.
          However, although the technology has been around for a while, it still
          does not present interfaces that are easy to use and understand. This
          workshop aims at bringing HCI and KG communities together to discuss
          how HCI methods could help identify and overcome the issues that keep
          Knowledge Graphs from better user interfaces.
